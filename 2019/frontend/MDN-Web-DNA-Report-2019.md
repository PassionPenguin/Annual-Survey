## 简介

你现在正在阅读的是网络上有关设计师和开发人员需求的全球性年度研究报告的第一版，是一份旨在塑造网络平台的未来的报告。

在只有一个开发者的平台上，其实也只需要有一个组织去研究开发人员的需求并决定将来如何实现这些需求就够了。但在网络这个平台上，要研究这些就不是那么简单的了。从浏览器厂商到研究行业标准的机构，网络这个话题需要多个组织一起参与功能决策。这导致变化可能会很慢才能产生，并意味着一些痛病之处可能需要很长时间才能解决。

在与参与标准制定和负责具体措施的落实的开发者们的讨论中，总是能够反复听到一个声音："我们需要听到更多开发者们的想法"。

这就是为什么 MDN Web 开发者需求评估渴求成为的：Web 开发者和设计师之声。

就像 Mozilla 社区一样，这份评估并非只是由我们 Mozilla 所有。这份报告也远不只是缝合各个浏览器厂商的优先事项，或是现有其他评估的一份镜像。我们的这些发现是在 MDN 产品顾问委员会的指引下得出的，并且这个调查的数据来源是由超过 30 个利益相关者委员会成员组织包括浏览器厂商、W3C 以及相关产业组织一起设计的。

如果没有来自 173 个国家的超过 28000 名开发者和设计师至少每人使用了 20 分钟完成调查，这份报告不会存在。也就是说，实际上社区贡献了超过 10000 小时的时长，帮助我们加深对 Web 开发者们对痛点、盼待与需求的理解。

受访者们贡献的数据实际上已经在改变着浏览器厂商的功能开发的优先程度，以更好的定位并处理开发者和设计师们的需求，包括 Web 上与否。通过每年制作这样一份报告，跟踪这段时间的变化的需求与痛点变的可能，让所有利益相关者看到他们在构建 Web 的明天上所付出的努力的价值。

## 调查参与者

### 受访者对象

对于这份开发者需求评估的第一代，我们关注点放在了至少花了他们一部分时间编写 Web 代码的人们（准确来说，包括了开发者和设计师们）。在目标读者之中其实偏向的是现在正与 Web 一起工作的人们。他们的声音被平台们所遗弃过，不管是因为无法满足还是别的原因，将由这份评估的未来的版本所揭晓。同样的，那些不能或并没有选择 Web 平台的人们，并不是本次研究的一部分。

### 数据来源

当这项调查最初开始的时候，我们在各个平台的 MDN 的账号上通过发推特或是 MDN 社区的其他帖子上宣传这项调查的。最开始的回应是最多样化的，受访者被分进了不同的来源渠道并打成了平局。随着时间的推移，MDN 官网上的横幅仍然挂在那里，也称为最突出的流量来源。MDN 的积极的宣传让受访者群体偏向了让那些关注使用 MDN 的人们，但毕竟 MDN 服务的是大多数的 Web 开发者和设计师群体啊，因此这份数据极其可观，也颇具研究价值。

### 实际数据

这份调查实际有 76118 名受访者填写，28474 份（37.4%）完整作答。部分作答或是低质量的作答并不包含在统计数据中。

### 调查结果

![P9](https://insights.developer.mozilla.org/reports/assets/images/web-developer-needs-assessment-2019/p9.svg)

完整的调查结果被按照性别、地区、国家、开发者类型和熟悉程度被进一步在下文中被分类。

### 按照性别分类

![P10](https://insights.developer.mozilla.org/reports/assets/images/web-developer-needs-assessment-2019/p10.svg)

我们这个项目最初的目标就是去获取一个更广，更能够代表全球开发者群体的一份评估报告。但即便我们尝试去获取有代表性的目标群体的数据，87.1% 的受访者是男性，8.2% 是女性，3.6% 是不愿透露的，以及 1.1% 表示两个选项都不适合自己。从这个角度来看，美国劳工统计局所估计的应该有 20% 的女性参与软件开发，尽管说我们所统计的并不一定与他们所统计的标准相同，但如果将我们的标准修改与美国政府一样，那么我们就拥有了 10.9% 的女性受访者比例。

调查数据上性别的差异也是 MDN Web DNA 报告第一代的一个缺陷，也是几乎所有的开发者调查报告的一个通病。数据上的差异，同样也导致我们处理数据的方式也有所变化。我们的方法是将女性或其他小众群体排开。我们曾经尝试通过单独分离，来在数据中呈现更多不同群体的反馈，但我们还是失败了。在我们这份报告的未来的别的版本，我们会继续尝试去针对更公平地代表开发者群体这个任务去奋斗，去减小或是尽量让偏差合理化。

我们在调查问卷中所提供的选项都经过 Mozilla 的法律团队的仔细审查。我们所提供的所有的四个选项都是有意为之，有针对性地发问的。我们在全球范围内开展了这项调查，并添加了一些需要提供个人身份信息的选择性问题。对不认同与出生时所确定的性别相一致的人的法律承认程度在世界各地差别很大。我们不希望有能将受访者置于危险境地的性别方面的数据。在收集到完成作答的问卷中，一共有 55.2% 的受访者回答了这些选择性问题

### 按照地区分类

![P11](https://insights.developer.mozilla.org/reports/assets/images/web-developer-needs-assessment-2019/p11.svg)

### 按照国家分类

这份调查报告是以英语并本地化为其他八种语言，按照字母表顺序排列如下：

* Arabic 阿拉伯语
* Chinese Simplified 简体中文
* France 法语
* Japanese 日语
* Korean 韩语
* Portuguese Brazil 巴西式葡萄牙语
* Russian 俄语
* Spanish 西班牙语

这些语言也同样是 MDN 网站受众最多的语言的组合。这些翻译更多地传播，让更多人参与到这份调查问卷中，也能作为为什么印度没有那么多受访者的一份解释。

虽然说某些国家的比例看起来低于预期，这份调查报告还是收集到了来自 173 个国家的受访者的问卷，其中 9 个国家占到了 61.7% 的回答数，而其他的 163 个国家的占比都低于 3%。这九个具有最突出回答贡献的国家分别是：

* 美国 - 17.9%
* 中国 - 8.2%
* 俄罗斯 - 7.7%
* 印度 - 6.2%
* 德国 - 5.7%
* 法国 - 4.9%
* 英国 - 4.4%
* 乌克兰 - 3.6%
* 加拿大 - 3.1%

### 按开发者类型区分

![P13](https://insights.developer.mozilla.org/reports/assets/images/web-developer-needs-assessment-2019/p13.svg)

我们的受访者被我们问到了：“你觉得你是什么类型的开发者”，并让他们能够多选回答。大多数的受访者都认为他们是全栈或是前端开发者。选择前端的开发者同样选择了另外的两个：基本上是 JavaScript 或是基本上是 CSS 和 HTML。共计 57.1% 的开发者选择了全栈，而仅仅只有 11.7% 的开发者选择了后端开发者。

### 按开发经验分类

![P14](https://insights.developer.mozilla.org/reports/assets/images/web-developer-needs-assessment-2019/p14.svg)

开发经验是以成为开发者时长的年数为标准分类的，公平的包括了近年（两年以内）的开发者到经验丰富的开发者（超过十年的开发经验），分别对应的是 32.8% 和 23.4%。被选择最少的是中级有经验的开发者（6 - 9 年，15.6%）。另外，超过一半的受访者（60.9%），拥有少于 6 年的开发经验。

## 需求评估

### 什么是需求

在与大家一起分享前十个开发者需求之前，让我们先来简要地了解一下什么是一个需求，以便更好地行文。

陈述一个需求的模板是在项目开始之初进行的 14 场预演访谈中定下来的，以 Web 开发者的角度写下，大纲是：

I am a __________________ (persona) trying to __________________ (verb) but __________________ (barrier) because __________________ (cause), which makes me feel __________________ (emotional reaction).

> 我是一个 __________ （形容自己），尝试想要 __________ （动词），但因为 __________ （原因），遇到了 __________ （障碍），让我感到 __________ （感受、情绪）

将这个模板放入实例中，可以是这样的：

我是一个游客，尝试想要去另外的国家旅游，但因为签证是复杂的，而且我的口语能力很差，遇到了办理签证上的问题，让我感到非常沮丧。

当我们决定在调查中使用需求陈述时，我们借鉴了设计思维和产品开发过程中的常见做法，以获得灵感。因为它们是从开发者的角度出发编写的，我们觉得这是一种直观的阅读、解释和排名的方式。

这个项目的需求陈述集中在受挫的感受上。如果 Web 开发人员在 Web 开发方面遇到挫折，浏览器厂商可能有潜在的机会来帮助解决这种挫折。

### 排序方法

我们使用了 MaxDiff 法，让受访者对总共 28 个需求的陈述进行排序。受访者则是看到了由每套四种需求陈述组成的十二套需求陈述。在每一组中，他们被要求选出一种让他们感到最不沮丧的需求和一种让他们感到最沮丧的需求。（单个需求语句可以在 12 套中出现不止一次，即重复出现）

需要注意的是，需求可能不是最不令人沮丧的，但这并不意味着它造成的挫败感最少。这可能意味着被调查者对该话题没有经验，或者在他们的工作中没有优先考虑该内容。

例如，“使网站无障碍化”在 28 个项目中排名第 24 位，这是相当低的。这并不意味着网站的无障碍化，没有改进的空间。我们在试点访谈中了解到，开发人员和设计师并不总是能够在可访问性上花费必要的时间。正因为他们不会在无障碍化上花费时间，这个话题并不会让他们产生挫折感。如果将来开发者和设计师在无障碍化上投入更多时间，他们的挫折感可能也会改变，排名也会随之改变。

### 主题

这 28 个需求含括在 14 个不同的主题之中。正如前面提到的，排名前十的主题中有四个与浏览器兼容性有关，这使得它成为排名最高的主题。排在前五名的主题还有编写文档、测试、调试和框架。

### 需求排名的不同看法

上述的排名是按照所有一共 28474 份完整作答的调查数据总结而出的，一共排序了 28 条

这份数据将会在更进一步的被分析，为大家提供一份更细致的评价。当看到这些分析结论之间差距的时候，请牢牢记住，这些偏差并不能说明好坏，只是实际数据上不同呈现方式所导致的。

我们的数据会被按照以下类别继续细化：

**国家** - 显示这七个国家的原因是，他们是 MDN 网站，也就是本次活动流量最大的来源上，拥有访问者最多的国家。

**性别** - 当我们看到这些结论，我们需要记住，受访者们选择性别的比例 —— 男性 87.1%，女性 8.2%。这也很好地解释了，为什么男性的需求列表与总体的需求列表出入不大，而女性的与总体的区别比较大。同样的，这些差距并不代表好与坏，只是实际数据上不同呈现方式所导致的。

**对 Web 的满意度** - 在这次调查中，我们让受访者对 Web 作为平台和一系列工具（查看下文，图 27）使用做出评价，并使用李克特量表从最不满到最满意作出分类，包括了非常满意、满意、不满意、非常不满意。

**熟练程度（使用年数）** - 我们提供了选项 —— 两年或更少，以及十年或更多等各种选项。

**开发者的类别** - 受访者在问卷中还勾选了最能够描述他们的开发者类型，而对于前端开发者来说有两种，JavaScript 开发者和 HTML、CSS 开发者。

### 开发者对需求列表的感受

![P26](https://insights.developer.mozilla.org/reports/assets/images/web-developer-needs-assessment-2019/p26.svg)

因为开发者需求评估是准备要每年都发布一份的，我们询问了受访者这 28 个需求的列表对一个 Web 开发者来说是否是一个非常公平的结果。大多数的受访者都赞同这个列表具有代表性，21.6 % 持中性态度，意味着我们还有大量的空间去优化这份列表。

## 对于 Web 的总体满意度

![P28](https://insights.developer.mozilla.org/reports/assets/images/web-developer-needs-assessment-2019/p28.svg)

通过这个项目，我们想要一种合适、恰当的方法来衡量 Web 开发人员和设计人员对 Web 作为平台的满意程度。我们希望这是一个可在未来重复再现的问题，以衡量满意度随时间的变化。

我们问受访者：“你如何评价作为一个平台和工具集使用 Web 构建你所需的内容的总体满意度？”

从数据反映到，大多数的受访者（76.1％）对 Web 是非常满意或满意的，而 9％ 的受访者对此非常不满意或不满意。

## Web 上还缺啥？

### 综观

我们设置了一个开发性的问题：“你想在 Web 上做些什么，但又缺少什么 Web 平台功能？”这是一个可选问题，默认不需要作答。

我们之所以提出这个开放式问题，是因为我们不知道能够有什么答案能作为一个可能的标准答案，因此我们打算将收集到的结果在调查以后再去整理数据。

在 28474 份完整作答的调查问卷数据中，由 12359 名受访者回答了这个问题 —— 仅仅只有一般的用户回答了。开放式问题是很难进行分析的，因为我们无法确定受访者对问题的陈述方式，无法确定对其回答适用的背景。考虑到这一点，我们仔细研究了答案，并消除了偏题的答案。例如，许多回复的形式为“不适用”或“没有缺失什么功能”。删除不相关的答案后，共计尚存 9570 份作答。

从这些作答中，我们随机挑选出了 1000 份答案，对它们进行了分类。

除了令人惊讶的大量回应暗示希望让 Web 能够轻轻松松取得世界统治地位之外，开发人员的需求分为 109 类。但是，在这些类别中，只有 7 个类别拥有总答案占比 3％ 或更多的答案：

* 与硬件的访问（12.4%）
* 浏览器兼容性（8.6%）
* 与文件系统的访问（4.7%）
* 性能（3.4%）
* 对 PWA 的支持（3.4%）
* 调试（3.3%）
* 与原生 API 的访问（3%）

有关 CSS 的需求的答案仅略低于 3％ 的 2.9％。大量的占比 2％ 的问题是关于避免在 Web 平台上使用 JavaScript 的答案（2.3％）和关于游戏的需求（2％）。

而对于其余的 99 个类别，每个类别所占的比重都不超过总数 1000 份回答的 2％。

因为该问题是开放式的，因此我们收到的答案列出了受访者希望在网络上实现的事情，但缺少这样做的平台功能。为了避免给受访者只作答一次与多次的权重不一，我们将第一份答复从列表中删除。在某些情况下，我们无法明白第一份作答是什么意思，或者受访者没有作答。在这些情况下，我们继续跳到列表中的下一项，直到我们删除了一分没有作答的数据或将列表中的第一个答案归类。

接下来的几段是简短的描述，除了标题以外，还进一步解释了类别，以及调查问卷中的详细内容。我们选择了最能体现该类别更深层含义的普通词汇。

### 对硬件的访问

大多数的回答都以 对硬件的访问 相似的或更简洁的形式出现。受访者们在答案中大多以 对硬件的访问 为答案。有些受访者的作答更为详细，一些其他常见的作答是 对通讯录、日历、相机等的访问。能够完美命中这分类的回答是：

* 拥有硬件的 API 的访问权限，能够以 Web 技术的编写能够部署呈现原生性能的应用程序。
* 在客户端浏览器中访问到更低级的硬件。
* 拥有对硬件更好的访问权限。我们可以更好的扫描数据，将一份扫描呈现到 `canvas` 之中，或是能够读取页面上被标记的内容。

### 浏览器兼容

这个分类的答案大多是希望能够拥有跨浏览器的统一的兼容，以及跨设备平台的。另外一个常见的需求是在浏览器之间能够拥有拥有更好的测试。CSS 和 JavaScript 则是浏览器兼容性请求中的两个最需要的部分，而能够完美命中这分类的回答是：

* 在不同浏览器能够有一样的渲染效果，因此客户们不会再抱怨字体在一个浏览器中挺棒的，但在另外一个就糟糕透了
* 将新技术当作标准，不用再担心浏览器是否支持
* 支持 IE 是下地狱一样的行为，是我们必须做的，而非我们希望做的。
* 不必担心 CSS 而在浏览器之间构建一样的体验。在 Chrome 以外写样式真是令人恼火 —— 指的是，到 IE 11 上乱的要死。

### 对文件系统的访问

访问文件系统应该可以算是对硬件的访问的一个自分类吧，但是却拥有大量的请求都写的是访问文件系统，足以自成一派了。大多数的回答都是简简单单的写着 访问文件系统，而有部分的回答则是表示用户需要给予权限，才能访问。能够完美命中这分类的回答是：

* 永久的本地存储的一个安全性和可用性解决方案。
* 直接保存文件到用户的电脑（有了权限以后）。
* 给予有限的权限让我们可以直接在浏览器中访问文件系统。虽说不可行，但如果有的话，让我们可以直接与文件系统交互。
* 直接操控系统文件（让用户可以在一个不是 Node.js 的在线 Web 应用程序中本地工作）。

### 性能

受访者们在不同的角度都提及了性能，有的希望能够通过特定的语言（大多数提及的是 JavaScript）知道用户的带宽。同样的，也将速度与原生应用程序相比较。能够完美命中这分类的回答是：

* 我非常期待更好的性能。现在大多数的工作都还是只能在后端完成，因为浏览器还是太慢了！性能真的是最重要的需要提升的一个因素。
* 看我在用着多少环境资源，作为性能的一部分。
* Web 应用程序（原生移动应用程序）的速度
* JavaScript 的性能太差了，我更希望在浏览器中使用 Python 或 Java，但这可一点都不可能啊。
* 精确判断用户当前的带宽。

### 对 PWA 的支持

归类为 对 PWA 的支持 的大多数答复是关于缺乏支持以及希望获得全面支持的愿望。并非所有浏览器厂商都为 PWA 提供相同的支持（就比如说 Safari 和 IE 11），这给开发人员带来了巨量的挫败感。另一个常见的答案是在应用商店中将 PWA 作为选项。最能体现该类别更深层含义的回答是：

* 所有供应商都提供全面的 PWA 支持。我想开发一款基于 Web 视图的应用程序，能够在 Web 上公开可用并在所有平台上均受支持的应用程序。
* 希望 PWA 能够越来越好 —— 我们仍在等待在 iOS 上获得与 Android 类似的 PWA 应用程序体验。当然，现在 Firefox 也不提供 PWA 应用程序的安装。
* Web 可以完成本机所做的大部分工作，但是 We b应用程序不像应用程序那样普遍使用，PWA 应该作为主要类别存在于主要应用程序商店中。
* 出现在应用程序市场中。

### 调试

撰写了有关调试的作答的受访者通常希望有更好的工具来使从捕获错误到解决错误的调试变得更加轻松便捷。最能体现该类别更深层含义的回答是：

* 更好地捕获和上传导致用户浏览器错误的情况。
* 更方便的调试方式。
* 在调试时修改源代码。
* 移动端调试。

### 对原生 API 的支持

被归类为对本机 API 的访问的答案类似于对硬件的访问或对文件系统的访问，因为开发人员希望与设备操作系统集成，以及还有让 Web 应用程序的效果更像本机应用程序。最能体现该类别更深层含义的回答是：

* 与其他桌面应用程序进行交互。
* 系统操作系统集成。
* 使用一组扩展的平台提供的组件。
* 我希望 Web 应用程序更原生化。

## 技术

### 程序语言

作为网络的核心技术，我们希望了解使用 JavaScript、HTML、CSS 和 WebAssembly 进行开发的开发人员的难点。

### JavaScript

JavaScript 的最大痛点是 缺乏浏览器 / 引擎 / 对给定语言功能的支持。不过，有 16％ 的受访者对 JavaScript 非常优秀……

![P40](https://insights.developer.mozilla.org/reports/assets/images/web-developer-needs-assesssment-2019/p40.svg)

### HTML

HTML 似乎是这些语言的闪亮之星，因为大约三分之一的受访者（35.3％）对该语言没有任何问题。同时，也有 31.5% 的人说，HTML 最大的痛点是缺乏对给定的功能的采用和支持。

![P41](https://insights.developer.mozilla.org/reports/assets/images/web-developer-needs-assesssment-2019/p41.svg)

### CSS

近一半（44％）的受访者表示，使用 CSS 的最大痛点是创建指定布局的挑战。由于 CSS 是用于设置网页样式的语言，结果也证实了，使用 CSS 很难实现所需的布局。我们可以用不同的方式解释这个数据，因此需要进一步研究。一种解释是 CSS 导致了很多开发人员使用该语言创建布局时感到悲伤。另一种解释是，开发人员正在尝试使用 CSS 来尽力而为以实现 Web 友好的布局而不是将其用于非 Web 设计领域。

![P42](https://insights.developer.mozilla.org/reports/assets/images/web-developer-needs-assesssment-2019/p42.svg)

### WASM WebAssembly

WebAssembly 是一项新技术，因此只有极少数的受访者（851 位）有足够的经验回答，占总作答数的 3%。下面的结果来自一个比 JavaScript、HTML 和 CSS 小得多的样本。大家认为，WASM 最大的痛点是缺少调试工具支持（51.4％）。

![P43](https://insights.developer.mozilla.org/reports/assets/images/web-developer-needs-assesssment-2019/p43.svg)

### 对新技术的包容程度

开发人员在采用新技术时面临的最大障碍是跨浏览器的互通性，这与十大需求可是一致的！那十大需求中，其中四个与浏览器兼容性有关。

![P45](https://insights.developer.mozilla.org/reports/assets/images/web-developer-needs-assesssment-2019/p45.svg)

### 浏览器

Chrome 和 Firefox 在浏览器开发人员支持方面处于领先地位，分别为 97.5％ 和 88.6％。第三名是 Safari，占 59.6％。

## 预演调查的结果

### 前十个需求的更深入挖掘

### 浏览器支持

![](https://insights.developer.mozilla.org/reports/assets/images/web-developer-needs-assessment-2019/p18_browsercopatibility.svg)

In the full list of needs browser compatibility was the dominant theme. Four need statements made the top ten:

&#35; 1 Having to support specific browsers (e.g., IE11).

&#35; 3 Avoiding or removing a feature that doesn’t work across browsers.

&#35; 4 Testing across browsers.

&#35; 5 Making a design look/work the same across browsers.

Of all the pilot interview findings, browser compatibility was the topic discussed using strong language especially if IE was at the heart of an issue.

While IE11 is decreasing in share as Microsoft shifts users to Edge (and the forthcoming Chromium-based version), it continues to be a large source of frustration to developers due to being over-represented in enterprises, legacy line of business apps, and certain industries. The prevalence of users accessing the web through IE is beyond both web developers’ control and Microsoft’s. In some cases, it’s the management of a company that dictates what browsers should be supported, ignoring data that suggests users are accessing a site through browsers other than those mandated.

*“I don’t know why people still use IE. I find \[browser compatibility\] very frustrating, especially as a front end designer. IE is such a curse my god, why do people use it?”*

*“Browser compatibility, by and large, shouldn’t be an issue and for us specifically is a nightmare...we have so many people accessing our application from their office, which means they are running IE11. Which is something that I don’t care about, except I needed to code for it to keep my job. It’s just a hair-pulling frustration...it is tragic.”*

*“\[Browser compatibility\] is important, but I think people put importance on the wrong parts of it. Everywhere I’ve worked they say, ‘It has to work on IE11,’ and I’m like, ‘Really because I think it needs to work on mobile Safari but not IE11.’ It’s frustrating trying to get stuff working on IE...the manufacturers have said stop using that.”*

*“...the most annoying thing for me is...browser compatibility, to feel like something is simple enough to where, it shouldn’t render differently in Edge, but it does. That’s the big one, especially because \[in my industry of\] oil and gas, most people aren’t very technically inclined...”*

*“... this \[doesn’t\] strictly \[relate\] to accessibility it more relates to browser compatibility. But Edge is not particularly accessible. It’s optimization for JAWS, which is the only popular software for professional blind users is abysmal...it’s recommended that Edge is not used at all, which makes users divert or revert to older versions of IE, which is a mess.”*

Browser compatibility is getting better though, at least some see a light at the end of the tunnel.

*“There are not many problems we have with browser compatibility... every once in a while, we’re supporting IE11, and that’s the only old browser we’re supporting. Even that we’re noticing that less than half a percent of our users are using IE 11...”*

*“If you think about the amount of weird tricks \[you had\] to pull off  
ten years ago to make sure that your website looks good in every web browser, and the amount of things you have to do now is kindergarten level. You just have to do a few things every browser now supports a decent enough level of features.”*

While it might seem easy to point fingers at IE, all browsers have their quirks, and developers have had to learn those quirks and adapt to make their site work well enough after tediously testing across browsers and, in some cases, having to remove a feature.

*“...it’s hard to achieve cross browser compatibility so everything works...it’s a lot of testing...to do with all these browsers, which \[isn’t\] a lot of fun...”*

*“Modern browsers are supposed to support same-site cookie attribute. But it turns out the latest version \[of Safari\] has a bug...it not being compatible with this specific version of Safari means that we cannot use them in general...all this is really frustrating.”*

*“...you have to make sure that whatever you develop works as expected. There are fringe cases, say, if I were to make a web form \[and it\] works fine and dandy in Chrome, but for whatever reason, maybe it’s not behaving in another browser. Then you go down the rabbit hole of trying to debug or trying to research what the root cause is. Sometimes it’s due to an unsupported API or feature that’s being used, and that being the hallmark feature of the app...”*

*“...I understand the need to cater to browser compatibility, for example, you can pull up the metrics of any given project or site, and then you can look at the technology or the browser that’s being used to visit your site...you can make a case to say, ‘Well, a lot of our users are using a specific browser, we need to ensure that our project looks \[in\] the best light. That’s what can withhold certain features that you implement on your project.”*

Though not captured as a need statement by itself, at the crux of browser compatibility is the users’ experience. If it doesn’t work across the browsers your users use, then they aren’t going to be accessing your site, which has business implications.

*“I think it’s very important that your audience can use your product*

*no matter what device or browser they’re using, they should be able to use your service. I think this is very important to be able to deploy your product across a range of browsers.”*

*“\[Browser compatibility is\] an implicit point where it is so important because everyone should have the same experience.”*

### 编写文档

![](https://insights.developer.mozilla.org/reports/assets/images/web-developer-needs-assessment-2019/p18_documentation.svg)

Survey participants rated aspects of documentation as the second most frustrating need:

&#35; 2 Outdated or inaccurate documentation for frameworks and libraries.

Documentation is so important, and hence leads to such high frustration because it is one of the things that gives developers an accurate picture of how things should work. It is also one of their go-to resources for overcoming frustration, which is why developers find inaccurate or outdated documentation so frustrating.

*“...\[documentation\] really gives you the right picture of how things should be working...if you aren’t sure how things are supposed to work it’s so hard to get them right or it’s so hard to identify possible issues with what you’re doing.”*

*“Documentation is \[the central thing for helping me overcome frustration\] partly because...you think you knew something but then after reading up on said feature or said documentation, it’s like, ‘Ah, I should be implementing it this way,’ rather than a learned know-how, so to speak.”*

Documentation was one of the reasons why developers dislike frameworks. They find there is not enough information about how to use a framework optimally.

*“...nobody tells us what is the optimal way to use \[a framework\]. It took me a lot of time to understand how to format my bootstrap file...this  
is the tree I have to make to make sure that it is optimal and it can be used by multiple different devices. That is something nobody tells us, exactly...That’s something I really like about Vue.JS they tell how to use it optimally.”*

### 调试

![](https://insights.developer.mozilla.org/reports/assets/images/web-developer-needs-assessment-2019/p18_debugging.svg)

In the full list of needs, debugging debuted at #6:

&#35; 6 Discovering bugs not caught during testing.

The frustrations developers experience with debugging are more about the time it takes and the fact that if you’re debugging, then something is wrong. Trying to find the bug and how it manifests in a browser is also a source of frustration.

*“Debugging is always irritating...\[It’s\] a never-ending process. I can have a hundred test cases, I can debug \[them all\]. I’ll come back, one user will call, ‘This particular thing is not working,’ so I have to go back again, and realize, ‘Okay, this is again a problem because \[of\] something so debugging is frustrating.”*

*“\[The\] level of frustration \[ for debugging\] would be high up there... debugging a layout it isn’t so much of a mystery if it’s HTML and CSS...in the context of JavaScript I feel like you’re always debugging throughout the process, making sure that it hits certain breakpoints. If I hit all the marks...for me, then I’m satisfied. Debugging should definitely be more along the lines of ops \[and\] code versioning because I feel like that’s where a lot of that happens in tandem.”*

*“...the only reason that \[debugging is\] frustrating is because of the multiple places to go to do it when you’re actually having to confirm how it appears in a browser.”*

*“Debugging is just frustrating because if you are already debugging, you’ve done something wrong. You shouldn’t write to the point where you debug, you should just test so that you don’t waste time debugging...it’s important because if you are debugging that means there’s something that’s not working right that’s bothering you. Hopefully, you catch it before it’s live.”*

### 框架

![](https://insights.developer.mozilla.org/reports/assets/images/web-developer-needs-assessment-2019/p18_frameworks.svg)

One of the unknowns stakeholders had about web developers is why they like frameworks — what about frameworks do they like? It turns out, the relationship with frameworks is more of a love/ hate meaning developers don’t necessarily like frameworks. In the survey, frameworks made the cut in two of the top ten needs:

&#35; 7 Supporting multiple frameworks in the same code base.

&#35; 8 Keeping up with a large number of new and existing tools or frameworks.

Some developers envy the server-side world where there’s more stability and only a few leading frameworks, whereas, on the front end side, developers feel they are getting whiplash just trying to keep up with the many frameworks that exist.

*“I think it’s frustrating that there’s no good way to manage your dependencies of applications on the web, compared to Maven in the Java world, which has been a long, steady, common tool which has been available for many years.”*

*“It could very well \[be\]...frameworks are entering a maturity where you’ll have a few, React and Angular, in perpetuity, the same way that the server-side frameworks have settled down into three or four that everyone uses. But it’s not there yet, and it’s a lot of whiplashing and eye-rolling...but it also keeps me employed.”*

Some developers try to avoid frameworks altogether mainly because it’s too hard to keep up with new and existing frameworks.

*“...the pace of change in the framework arena has a high level of frustration, so I try to avoid them.”*

*“I’m not a big fan of frameworks... I don’t feel like they get you that much...\[ frameworks\] always look more complicated than they ought to be \[but\] they’re presented \[as\] the greatest thing since sliced bread. I’m not convinced.”*

On the flipside, frameworks offer efficiencies allowing developers to reuse something that’s already been solved for.

*“I use the term framework to mean a new set of modules that have been prebuilt to trivialize the tasks...if there’s a complex series of blocks of code that you need...in order to get around a certain issue of rendering something or processing something, then somebody is going to create a library to make that more efficient.”*

*“React is a joy to use, Angular is a very solid one. You can pick and choose whatever you want now. Each one of the big ones, it’s really well made...allows you to do whatever you need. \[Frameworks are\] important because it does allow many companies to create something good with not much effort...it’s to the point where it’s nice, but it’s somewhat in the background because everybody got so good at it.”*

Participants mentioned browser-based APIs, web components and object-oriented JavaScript as potential solutions or methods for reducing the need for frameworks.

*“...in the last few years, the browser’s did enormous development...all these browser APIs are good enough in order to avoid specific platforms. What I’ve learned from the last 10-15 years is that every, let’s say, half a year, some kind of framework is hyped. People tell you, ‘It’s the best that they’ve ever seen.’ Half a year later, something else comes around, and you have to change your code base. The most reliable project I’ve seen that works over many years, just purely use browser based API...I resorted to using pure browser, cross browser supported* *APIs...they work for many years”*

*“...a lot of the problems that frameworks are trying to solve are artifacts of the non-object-oriented JavaScript, the older JavaScript way of doing things... it’s my hypothesis that a lot of that goes away if you just take a more modern design approach to developing for the web,... I’ve been playing with web sockets...it’s just a shared object. That’s one way of doing it. \[Another way is\] with remote method indication.”*

*“I believe in web components. It will be nice if \[ frameworks\] are not going to be as important as before.”*

### 隐私

![](https://insights.developer.mozilla.org/reports/assets/images/web-developer-needs-assessment-2019/p18_privacy.svg)

In the full list of needs tested in the survey, there were two need statements that related to privacy. One made the top ten list, coming in ninth:

&#35; 9 Managing user data to comply with laws and regulations.

Depending on the part of the world a developer resides, privacy is seen as getting better (GDPR) or worse (Australian Assistance and Access Bill). These laws and regulations have implications on both protecting a developer’s privacy as a user of the web, how they approach their work, as well as their career trajectory. When laws and regulations were mentioned in conjunction with privacy, there was a belief that maintaining privacy, whether their own or users, is beyond the scope of technology, meaning Governments need to step in to hold technology companies accountable for their use of private data. However, in some countries, it can be the Government who is exploiting data.

*“I saw \[privacy\] more in terms of \[the\] end customer instead of me \[the\] developer... me as a user I’m feeling much safer now, in terms of privacy than a year and a half ago because...if you’re in Europe, GDPR is going to keep your data in a much better place.”*

*“It feels like many services and apps...are designed to mislead people that don’t know about the technicalities. I think \[privacy\] is super important and it’s frustrating that it’s hard to protect users, but I think this should improve with regulations...with laws like GDPR from Europe. I mean, it’s the only way really. Tech solutions like the Do Not Track setting in your browser...I’m sure people wanting to track you \[will\] exploit your data and everything. They will always find ways unless it’s really regulated. I don’t think that technology alone can protect people.”*

*“...the impact \[of GDPR\]...we have to do the work to ensure that when people ask for us to delete the data, we need to ensure that we are deleting all the data that we have from them...that means deleting anything for logs, making sure that everything is deleted from all databases...before this we were still doing that kind of work but we didn’t have the same pressure I suppose...and it wasn’t clear for users that they had the right to exercise that...”*

*“privacy...that depends on the company where you work honestly. In Europe, \[privacy is\] much easier...because you have to specify everything you do and they have to be able to delete everything. GDPR helps so much.”*

*“\[Privacy\] that’s a big one...we just pass the Assistance and Access Bill, a huge blow to the Australian security and IT industry...you can be instructed to make changes to your app so that the government can get access to it, and you’re not allowed to tell anyone. It’s at the forefront of everyone’s minds here...if I were to go look for another job, there’s plenty of companies who said they don’t want to hire devs in Australia anymore because we’re suddenly a security risk.”*

Beyond the laws and regulations surrounding privacy, the pilot interviews revealed that privacy is personal. One thing top of mind when discussing privacy was protecting their privacy as a user of the Web, followed by the role of privacy in their work. When it came to protecting their own privacy and the privacy of their users, developers felt it is hard to do. There is a belief that maintaining their privacy is their right, and it is something they value, so they try to keep their users’ privacy safe too. Maintaining privacy comes with tradeoffs in terms of the features you’re able to access.

*“You’re asking me why privacy matters? It’s my right.”*

*“When I use the web, I feel uncomfortable. I ask myself, ‘Is this secure enough or will I have to use incognito version?’ I’m not sure how much I can protect my information and security on the web...what is important for me is that I keep these values in doing my development.”*

*“...it’s quite frustrating to protect my privacy on the web, but it’s really important for \[users\] to keep their privacy safe. I think most developers should consider this when they build a website. As a consumer, I think it’s really important to keep my privacy safe. I don’t want to give my specifics or I don’t want to receive any ads based on my activity on the web.”*

*“...being a German \[privacy is\] very important to us...I think this is the hardest part to achieve typically because you want to have all these cool features, want to use all these platforms, so it’s hard to achieve privacy, but still, at the same time it’s very important to us...this is one of the most difficult issues and that’s why I’m using Firefox and not Chrome for instance today.”*

*“...I’m thinking that mostly as a user...you install an app and it wants permissions. I’m always like, ‘Why does it need that, it doesn’t need that,’ you don’t want to read \[the privacy policy\] you just click okay...it’s a problem...you can’t trust these apps...they can access all your data and all with any webpage you visited...I find that very frustrating as*

*a user it ought to be more precise about exactly what it’s going to do and what it won’t do...it’s just creepy.”*

### 安全性

![](https://insights.developer.mozilla.org/reports/assets/images/web-developer-needs-assessment-2019/p18_security.svg)

Rounding out the top ten needs is security, coming in at tenth:

&#35; 10 Understanding and implementing security measures.

What did we learn about security from the pilot interviews that lead to this need? First, let’s look at how people defined security. Developers used terms such as authentication and privacy in their definitions.

*“Security means that no one can get access to any part of the system that they are not authorized to access, and no one person can see any data from the system that they’re not allowed to access.”*

*“\[When I think about security\] I think about authentication...how do you successfully guard against malicious login or malicious attacks on things that are supposed to be secure.”*

*“...\[a site\] is considered secure \[if\] it’s working in the way you intended, respecting all the access rules...when your users are aware of what’s happening with the data, \[and\] when the data users submit is only used for what they intended \[it\] to \[be used for\].”*

*“Security to me is like the authenticity of data, authentication of users, and being sure that the other guy I’m exchanging data with is the guy he pretends to be...it’s very important to have trust so that your users know that they receive data from you and send data to me. I think authentication here is key.”*

*“Privacy is about keeping people’s data safe whereas security can have further implications like your app being brought down or somebody hacking it \[so it\] no longer does what you’re expecting it to do. Like proper password protection and stuff to stop people’s accounts* *from being able to get hacked, and then that information being used for other stuff...so privacy is a part of security.”*

Beyond the definitions of security, the main thing we heard is that web developers don’t know enough about security which creates a feeling of concern and frustration that someone with more knowledge can find and exploit security flaws. This feeling causes stress, especially because security is viewed as very important.

*“Security is one of those things that I’m sure we should be doing better on, we haven’t had any issues yet, but all you need is one issue...”*

*“I always have concerns that there are security issues that I haven’t figured out yet. I’ve thought very hard about whether or not it’s possible for malicious third parties to authenticate as someone else...I haven’t figured \[it\] out yet but I feel like I’m not quite smart enough in this area, to know whether or not that’s possible.”*

*“...\[with security\] I always have this fear...I use JWT to authenticate my request after initiating. I always have that doubt that it’s not unbreakable...a good hacker might be doing that...I think there are a lot of things to be learned and steps to be followed. I have not done that. Maybe it’s my ignorance on that side.”*

*“Security is very important for any of our customers at any time for anyone to be honest...you have to make sure that \[user\] data is contained with us...applying security it’s very frustrating because I myself am not very good at security and I personally feel that there are not enough online resources that actually explain why your security might be flawed or what are you doing wrong that might lead to flaw in secu- rity. Mostly, I don’t really understand security.”*

We also heard that the ways to implement security feel like a hack in and of themselves, which is a result of the evolution of the web. As security became important, new ways of ensuring security evolved out of necessity, but those were reactionary developments.

*“Security is so important...having bad security can be catastrophic  
for your business and for individuals. It’s one of the most important things right now...every other day there is some breach and a lot of user data is exposed. It’s so bad...it’s so frustrating because it’s so hard to get it right. There are so many things on the web that are broken from the beginning because the way that the web has evolved...it’s really hard to get it right. Many of the things that we’ve used in the past for security to protect things like tokens...they feel like a patch*

*or a hack on top of the whole system...feeling that it’s impossible to get your app to be truly secure \[because\] that doesn’t exist. There will always be vulnerabilities in everything in protocols and fundamental libraries...it’s so hard and so important at the same time.”*

The third thing we heard about security is a two-way relationship with users. If you get security wrong it adversely affects users. However, you may implement the best security features you know how to, but if users access a site through passwords, as a web developer you have very little control over whether or not they choose a secure password.

*“Security is essential...it requires so much attention, and it can be frustrating...because it’s something that you don’t want to get wrong. It’s going to stress you out because getting it wrong might be a really bad thing for your users.”*

*“...I’m trying to make sure that people \[use\] better passwords for our system...we give them logins for the production server and also a staging server...‘123’ is their password. I have to make sure that they change that but sometimes I don’t know what password they’re using because it’s their password, I’m not supposed to know it. What we find* *is that we’re only as secure as the passwords that our users use.”*

As you can see with the perception that security feels like a hack and being tied to customer logins, security is closely related to needs or frustrations that might arise due to the pace of change of the web and authentication.

### 对剩下的需求的更深入挖掘

### 测试

![](https://insights.developer.mozilla.org/reports/assets/images/web-developer-needs-assessment-2019/p18_testing.svg)

During the kickoff meeting for this project, stakeholders shared their thoughts on what was already known about testing. What was captured is that automated testing is hard to get started and there are many different types of testing like unit, integration, and functional. What was unknown was the types of tests developers are running and how or if that causes frustration.

The pilot interviews revealed that some developers feel that it’s frustrating to keep track of all the available tools to conduct a proper test and automated tests are not always an appropriate method for the web.

*“The frustrating part \[about testing is\] not being aware of the tools available to conduct a proper test.”*

*“The web is not an automated test driven place because there’s too much interdependency between JavaScript, HTML and CSS. I didn’t really see the benefit of doing automated testing here...typically you react to user events and then change something on the UI...I think that is better tested by a human...while back end code that interacts with databases, servers, and stuff like this, where the logic is pretty clear that’s easily testable using unit testing or something...”*

*“I don’t automate my test normally like you’re supposed to...I like it to run on both the server side and the client side, and I can test it interactively. It’s just not always possible to do things to automate the test... it’s not always clear how to do that, and how to check the result...if I can play around with it, that’s the way I like to test things. And it can be frustrating, it’s always frustrating when things don’t work.”*

Participants felt testing can be frustrating because it can take a significant amount of time to write certain tests and the ease of writing those tests is related to a developers’ experience with testing.

*“A couple of reasons come to my mind immediately \[about why testing is frustrating\]. The front end testing it’s not always easy to do unit testing. That’s what I have felt. I have not written extensive test cases before...I know the importance of test driven development and we should write code for testing, and then only write the application so that it won’t fail, and those kind of things. Also, I think \[it’s frustrating\] because I haven’t done it that much. I always used to manually test my code...”*

*“Some projects you might not have time to do the unit tests, there is  
a time factor involved where you don’t have the time to write first the test cases, then you write the code that is failing, and then you have to make it pass. We don’t have that kind of time for the project, because it’s a quickly moving product.”*

*“We also do system tests that are harder to write \[than unit or integration tests\] because there are more things to consider \[and more\] time consuming to write when considering all the interactions with the browser. That’s why testing is not zero frustration.”*

Opinions did differ, slightly. On the flipside of not having the time to test, is the belief that taking the time to run tests can reduce stress.

“Wow, if you’re a developer, \[testing is\] your bread and butter. It shouldn’t be stressful to test, it should be something that you want to do. Because you know this is going to actually reduce stress.”

The types of tests developers run varies as do the tools they use to test.

*“\[I do\] unit testing, but it’s component level testing. A single compo**nent testing TypeScript and HTML together...we used to test JavaScript, whereas now we try to test the whole component together...the back end devs do some kind of back end testing. We’ll run automated end to end tests, you login and go through a flow on a page. We were using Protractor and Selenium. Now we’re using Test Cafe and we do a heap of manual testing. We have as many testers as we have devs, and they do all of the cross browser testing, cross device testing, all that kind of stuff.”*

*“\[I run\] as many tests as possible. I’m a true believer of the green-red testing, then integration tests to make sure things work, and then use Cypress or Puppeteer...maybe your QA is going to use Selenium...you’ll have to cover the critical path of your website, at least with end to end testing...there’s so much choice...you can test it by checking the values, you can abstract other things in a snapshot testing. As long as you are able to check your volume on your logic, and then check that your components are well structured, you should be in a good position to iterate quickly without worrying too much about what could break.”*

*“...on the testing side, all of the angular testing tools they just flatten out all of your asynchronous code, and magically make it synchronous so that you can understand it and follow the flow more easily.”*

### 验证

![](https://insights.developer.mozilla.org/reports/assets/images/web-developer-needs-assessment-2019/p18_authentication.svg)

Authentication was often described as difficult and frustrating for a variety of reasons, but mainly due to the complicated nature of it and the threat that exists if you get it wrong. However, authentication can be easier if a developer is willing to divest control to a third party.

*“It’s hard to write a secure API for mobile apps to authenticate against. There are flows but they are very convoluted. \[It’s\] not nice for users and not nice for developers to implement. The whole authentication mechanism with passwords and everything that feels like it should be much easier, especially with mobile where you have other ways to authenticate...like using your fingerprint or using your face. I hope it improves with standards, but it still feels very frustrating in the sense that is so hard to get it right.”*

*“OAuth2...it’s a complicated sort of thing...the thing that bothered me about it more than anything was that \[logging in with Google or Facebook\] even though they use the same app, the code that was used \[was\] messy. Even though they were using the same protocol, they weren’t really the same, they were just really different...I started downloading...a piece of suggested code to run on the server...even though they’re using the same protocol they were so different as far as actually setting them up on my server and how to handle it...it was just confusing, it all \[should\] be simpler than that.”*

*“I think the whole the whole notion of authentication and authorization it’s just fraught with difficulty...you’ve got people out there all the time, they’re trying to screw with it, trying to break it. It’s difficult and frustrating and important.”*

*“Authentication is generally a nightmare...I’m not that comfortable when there’s opaque layers of abstraction, and authentication very rapidly becomes like, ‘Oh, there’s this encrypt hashing algorithm,’ I*

*don’t know what that is and frankly, neither do any of my buddies who actually got bachelor’s degrees in computer science. It rapidly becomes impenetrable save for certain people. And that’s even setting aside the issue of, ‘Are you storing this as a cookie, or are you storing this as a JSON Web Token?’ Well, that’s a new technology that has a ton of pointy edges. And now the tide is moving against JSON Web tokens...”*

*“Setting up authentication is either a bit of a nightmare if you’re doing it yourself, or it’s incredibly simple, if you’re willing to just divest yourself of control over everything, just a leitmotif, a theme in web development.”*

### 性能

![](https://insights.developer.mozilla.org/reports/assets/images/web-developer-needs-assessment-2019/p18_performance.svg)

Performance was not often mentioned as one of the top items that causes frustration, however, it is something that developers find important. It’s important because it directly impacts the users’ experience on a site. Performance also ties back to a broad view of accessibility where a site should perform across a range of devices.

*“Performance can affect a lot of users’ experiences \[and whether\] they stay on the page...they need to see something...with information as soon as they land. It’s one of the things to keep the user on the site or the application.”*

*“Performance that should be your first things together with \[privacy, testing, tools, and accessibility\] because you want the user to be able to reach your website anywhere, no matter the connection no matter the device.”*

*“\[Performance\] is closely tied to accessibility in a lot of ways, which makes it quite important. If your app is huge and slow then it’s annoying for someone on a brand new MacBook, but it’s unusable for someone on a low end phone, and wasting people’s bandwidth and download and stuff. So it’s important in that respect...”*

*“Performance in terms of user experience, I think it’s very important to ensure that your app or your project is performing the way \[your users\] expect it to...”*

*“...the page should load quickly and shouldn’t keep the user waiting.”*

Developers referenced performance as a source of frustration because it’s hard to find the time to make a site perform well on low powered devices or difficult to pinpoint what is causing the performance issue. This fits with the survey results where, “Pinpointing

existing performance issues,” ranked as the twelfth need, out of 28. Another reason performance was mentioned as a source of frustration is the nature of the business itself. Businesses that experience rapid growth in a short amount of time strain systems and businesses must adapt.

*“...it’s hard to find the thing that makes your application slow. And it’s hard to debug, sometimes how or what affects performance. We have to isolate everything and try to iteratively find out what’s degraded performance.”*

*“I don’t feel that frustrated with performance in general, I think that are a lot of tools both server side and client side that help...in many cases it’s just hard to find the time to do the work and to make sure that your app works on not as powerful devices.”*

*“We’re doing a lot better. Six months ago, we were doing a lot worse with performance. The problem was that, \[and\] this is a good problem to have, we were constantly getting new \[users\]. We’re probably about 100,000 unique \[users\] every month \[whereas\] four months ago, we’re probably about 30,000. We’ve tripled in the last three months. That has put a lot of strain on our systems. We’ve had to work hard to... parallelize our computation.”*

Developers referenced many server side and client side tools that help them resolve performance issues. Most often referenced were network debugging tools, developer consoles, Lighthouse, and New Relic tools.

*“...with my current app that I’m working on, the performance is so bad that I just run it through Lighthouse, and that’s enough to say, ‘Hey, it’s taking eight seconds to load or 20 seconds to load sometimes... there’s some pretty obvious things that we can do.’ In my previous* *place, we got beyond that, where we needed to look more into the details of what we could work on, again Lighthouses was mostly what we used because it does give you a breakdown of stuff like that. There’s other Google tools that we’ve been using that I do not recall the name of...we’ve got monitoring and stuff that I can look at. Everyday, I get warnings, ‘Oh, the app is taking more than two seconds to respond...yep, that’s pretty standard.’ Those are driven from New Relic.”*

*“I’ll go into the developer console and look at the network tab, and see how fast things are loading, how many round trips it’s making just to load the first page...you can fix by bundling stuff together into one file that loads instead of having to make twenty different trips to the server to get the pieces to put the page together...there’s a lot of different little tricks that you can do to make things load more quickly.”*

During the kickoff, stakeholders had questions about what it means to be performant. The pilot interviews did not reveal any one measure, instead it was unique to the developers and the types of projects they’re working on. Developers define their own performance metrics as needed in a way that made sense for their work.

*“I measure \[performance\] in terms of payload, time to interaction, and amount of requests. Of course, this needs to be set to comply on rules that change from project to project.”*

*“In my case, I \[measure performance\] on what is an acceptable response time...since I work mostly in the server. I just look at graphs and try to see if most requests are within acceptable response time.”*

*“Well, of course, you will always \[have\] some kind of \[performance\] metric...sometimes it’s very easy. If you have a video conversation...you need to have some very hard limits on round trip or on frames per second. I typically try to define \[a\] performance measure, which gives me*

*an indication of what good actually means...I try to always measure it in some way.”*

*“\[When\] we’re talking about the entire system as a whole, they are different aspects of performance...from a web developers point of view, we need to make sure that \[our users\]...believes that, even if it takes longer than it should, \[it\] doesn’t feel like it takes a very long time.”*

### 本地化

![](https://insights.developer.mozilla.org/reports/assets/images/web-developer-needs-assessment-2019/p18_localization.svg)

The frustrations developers experience with localization expand beyond the traditional notion of accounting for the visual impacts of different languages, although that can be a source of frustration. Localization can mean understanding cultures and preferences in those cultures in terms of how people formally write their names so that you

can account for that when designing input fields or understanding date and time format preferences. Getting these things wrong can lead to a bad user experience. Localization is also seen as something that is not just in the realm of responsibilities for a developer, it’s something developers and designers have to work on together.

*“Most of my work has been aimed at Australian customers, \[but a\] related thing we did deal with at my last job was people’s names and things like the idea that everyone has a first name and a family name and that they should be in that order, which is not even a little bit true...It’s a localization \[issue\] because the people were in Australia but they were from somewhere else. It’s a problem because we’re doing identity matching so we need to be able to match people’s names across different identities. Basically, the answer was, ‘If your name isn’t in a standard format, you have to go into a shop and deal with it,’ which was not ideal...the people who originally designed the system were all white, Australian men...because it was built that specific way in the first place, it was hard to change it later. Whereas if they had people from more diverse backgrounds to start with, then it would have been built in from the beginning instead of tacked on later.”*

*“\[I was\] using an app today that wouldn’t let me change the date out of American format. So I’m really frustrated about localization. That was as a user...It’s so annoying, especially living in Australia. You’re using stuff from overseas almost always, and if you can’t localize it, it’s really noticeable all the time...it’s super frustrating, because it’s just like, ‘My God, everyone’s not where you are.’”*

*“Localization is just hard to get right. It’s not just a developer issue it’s something that developers and designers have to work together to manage. It’s just stressful because, in many organizations, there is not a real care for it. If you do localization as a second thought your interface is going to look horrible and then you have to fix it. But you didn’t start with a user interface that was enabling the ability to do it, so then you’re just going to waste time.”*

*“Localization can be difficult because sometimes you have to render the page from right side to left side, it’s not left to right. There are several steps involved. Typically that can \[create\] a little bit of frustration if you want to do localization in a language that you don’t know well. For example, a person who knows Spanish can do the localization well if he knows English and Spanish. If they don’t know Spanish, and if they had to do it, I think it there might be a little bit of frustration.”*

### 变化速度

![](https://insights.developer.mozilla.org/reports/assets/images/web-developer-needs-assessment-2019/p18_paceofchange.svg)

Developers acknowledge the web is an environment that changes, often quickly. It’s a reality that they’ve come to accept — almost with an air of resignation.

*“...we’re pretty good about keeping on top of things...whatever happens, happens.”*

*“As a developer, I think I should just accept sometimes the reality is the way it is so... if the environment changes quite fast...no matter how fast or how slow, I need to adapt.”*

*“Trends it’s important to follow them because it’s nice to see where the industry is going...they’re not as frustrating as I initially thought because, in the end, it’s just something that is always going to change. They’re going to be frustrating, or less frustrating, every few years because they’re going to be different...maybe you’re not going to like all of them, but they’re not even something that you have to follow strictly. So if it’s something you don’t really like, you can still rely on something else.”*

*“Every time I try to learn something new, I always think it is more complicated than it needs to be, and I think everybody has that feeling.”*

Not all change is bad, as change can lead to advancements in technology and more efficient ways of doing things but the frequency is difficult to keep up with and has implications for their work. Mainly, there’s a fear that as new technologies and tools become available, it will require work to migrate over and may break things in the process.

*“...the pace of change in the web arena is quite high. That’s frustrating somehow because you have to migrate all your projects and from one* *to the other tool.”*

*“Pace of change is frustrating and very important especially when it comes to updates, and how fast things change and things break. Sometimes you don’t know how, or why. And it’s so hard to keep up, especially when you are trying to maintain a different set of apps and some of them are legacy apps...because in many cases, it means your apps break.”*

*“...frameworks that are used for web development, in large part have to do with the efficiency of doing certain tasks that are currently popular and have not been efficient before... like encryption, were the MD5 checksum was discovered to be imperfect, at some point, cryptologically speaking...anyone who used it for extremely secure purposes needed to stop, which is stressful...that had to do with more of an advancement in math, which wasn’t anybody’s fault...I worry that an existing technology would be obsolete artificially quickly. If it was used in a form, or if your projects were dependent on it.”*

### 无障碍

![](https://insights.developer.mozilla.org/reports/assets/images/web-developer-needs-assessment-2019/p18_accessibility.svg)

Similar to authentication, accessibility, developers described it as difficult and frustrating. Developers understand the steps to follow to make a site accessible, but sometimes those steps are hard to get right, and the standards leave a lot to be desired. Often, a developer might be in a situation where their organization does not prioritize accessibility because, perhaps, it hasn’t come up as an issue, yet. The awareness of the need isn’t there. In these cases, accessibility is seen as less important than the time and effort required to implement it correctly.

“*Accessibility this is so important...it’s frustrating because it’s hard to get it right. I don’t think most web developers, myself included, put enough effort to make our apps accessible because it’s hard. You need to use these tools that simulate how it will be to use our app \[on\] a screen reader. The tools are there, we just don’t use them. I don’t think it’s fair to say I’m frustrated with accessibility because it’s just a matter of putting in the work to get it right. But it’s definitely super important because there’s so many things when you are developing a web app you just assume people are going to use it in the way you use it...when you don’t see the problem yourself, you don’t think of fixing it. So maybe this awareness what is missing in general?”*

*“Our application is not as accessible as it should be. I’m going to put \[accessibility as\] a low level of importance, not because it really should be that low but because we haven’t prioritized it...we sell our software to companies that provide our software in an iframe to their customers, and they’ve never once mentioned accessibility to us. In my previous company accessibility was very important, we made sure that everything accessible. But my current company, it’s it hasn’t once been mentioned, and I’m keeping in the back of my head that at some point, we’re going to need to work on this and make sure that our software is accessible, but it has not been mentioned by one of our customers.”*

*“\[Accessibility\] not that I want it to be an afterthought, but it’s the byproduct of the teams that I’ve been in. I do recognize how important it is, but it’s just not something that’s heavily invested upon, I think.”*

*“I would say the level of frustration that \[accessibility\] generates is greater than its level of importance, and it is important. Without minimizing its importance, it is important, you should be able to access web technologies, regardless of whether you have a visual, physical, or cognitive impairment. Currently, ARIA and web accessibility specs are a mess. We get accessibility audits that will be contradictory between each other. It is important and the way it is currently implemented... and the way the specs are interpreted (or not interpreted) and are clear (or not clear) is just a nightmare.”*

### 框架大纲

Some of the pilot interview findings shed light on needs that are outliers, which were not tested in the survey. We include them here as they are things that some web developers have to wrestle with, and that can cause frustration.

### 运维

![](https://insights.developer.mozilla.org/reports/assets/images/web-developer-needs-assessment-2019/p18_outliners.svg)

When referring to Ops, we mean anything related to creating the build and deploying it.

The audience who participated in the pilot interviews found Ops to be a source of frustration due to a lack of familiarity and practice. Most of the participants were not directly responsible for Ops or their projects don’t warrant that level of complexity.

*“I recognize that, for example, Ops, if I were more familiar or if I had enough repetition to get familiar then I could see that going down \[in frustration levels\] I think part of it is investing the time to get familiar with whatever the stack \[is\] or \[the\] core technologies that someone might be working with...”*

*“I started deploying on Heroku nowadays, I’m not very familiar with the continuous integration and deployment. I guess, maybe that’s why this is a problem...I don’t really understand the systems oftentimes.”*

*“...deployment, I wish I knew more...I haven’t had much opportunity to work with them and thus find them unclear. I don’t know what a coop cluster is. I have the most basic familiarity with docker images. We run a couple things on docker containers...I would say they’re incredibly important, at least to my job’s codebase..I put \[my\] frustration \[with* *it as\] lower...because I haven’t worked with them much. They just are opaque to me or unknowns.”*

*...if your Ops are fine \[then\] handling many, many deployments is not going to be too stressful because if your operations are fine, deploying a lot...it’s just not stressful, it’s just something you have to get comfortable doing.”*

### 工具

![](https://insights.developer.mozilla.org/reports/assets/images/web-developer-needs-assessment-2019/p18_outliners.svg)

Tools is a broad subject with ties to other areas of web development such as debugging, testing, and browser compatibility. Developers are frustrated by the pace of change in the tools arena. It is difficult to keep up with what exists. Even if they feel up to date on their options, deciding which tool to use can be a chore.

*“The situation that frustrated me about tools is more just me not knowing what’s out there...”*

*“An amazing number of \[tools\] are available, like tools to minimize images, to clean up the code, or to modify the code...there’s so many of them and they’re incredibly useful, but sometimes it can be difficult to decide which one to use.”*

*The reasons for choosing tools are whether or not something is supported, commonly used, or easy to use. That latter reason is a way in which developers measure how good a tool is because they don’t want to spend all their time learning how to use a tool. Commonly used tools offer developers a level of assurance that it will likely continue to be supported into the future.*

*“...before we start using any open source project, we carefully evaluate whether or not we think that this is a viable and supported project, or else this will just become more technical debt for us to handle in the future.”*

*“We try not to add lots of little libraries because we try not to have too many dependencies in our system. That tends to be where we have problems going forward. Like, we’ve integrated certain libraries into our system or use certain tools that are no longer supported. So we either have to start supporting them ourselves or abandon them.”*

*“...in terms of tools there seems to be new tools that come out. I err on the side of whichever is common...that’s the tool that I should be well-versed \[in\]... if I were to look up how to do something it has to go beyond what the documentation is willing to provide because, you’d have, for lack of a better term, superstar web devs, ‘Oh, they use this particular editor,’ if they use that then you know you have resources that you can go to.”*

*“... the frustration \[with tools\] is the ramp up time to be brought up to speed and the level of importance is because the tools that you interface with you want to spend most of your time getting to the end point rather than learning the tool.”*

*“I would choose a framework if it has a lot of libraries and tools that I can instantly use...and if it’s already tested, if it’s been there for some time. I would go with an old framework instead of new framework that is still developing...If there is a framework that’s been in the market* *for more than five years, I think that will have more tools, more testing tools, they are time tested, but a project that is still developing may not have \[that\].”*

Developers do their best to avoid tools that have quirks, bugs, or perhaps don’t run on Linux (if that’s their preferred operating system).

*“I’ve been using Linux for a long time on the desktop and on servers. I’m used to things not working out of the box and \[even\] so the things that \[still\] frustrate me are \[the tools\] that don’t work on Linux.”*

Obviously, \[tools are\] important because I’m using them all day, every day. They can be a bit frustrating because often the tools can’t keep up with the rate of change. Also, I find that they can be a bit flaky, stuff that just doesn’t quite work properly, which I think is partly just because getting things to work properly in JavaScript is hard. Little issues, like DevTools in Chrome, for ages you couldn’t resize the windows properly and it just seems to always be, I guess because they’re not selling the tools...they seem to break a lot.

*“The rest of the DevTools in the browsers are the most important thing I need, and they seem to be flaky a bit...little user interface issues that just make it frustrating...They’re definitely getting better and it feels bitchy to complain about them when I’m getting them for free. The browser manufacturers are companies that are trying to make money just like everyone else, and the browser is in a market. I guess the DevTools tools are there to encourage developers to develop for their platform a bit more, but it still feels like it’s a nice thing they’re doing for us, rather than a core thing...I probably should expect them to do it if they want me to their platform.”*

### 与他人协作

![](https://insights.developer.mozilla.org/reports/assets/images/web-developer-needs-assessment-2019/p18_outliners.svg)

Some of the pilot interview participants work on a team with others, which can cause frustrations. This is not unique to web developers, but how it impacts them is that it can create a more complex environment for managing code, and it can also dictate project requirements. There are also perceptions of different types of developers which color team dynamics. Most of these came about during deployment.

*“Frameworks are the byproduct of what management or senior developers...dictate...I work with developers that are not willing to make a change or try different frameworks, because why \[not\] go with some- thing that’s tested?...that’s when you start to get into red tape...I was trying to pitch possibly migrating to React...back in 2016...long story short, it wasn’t something legal was okay with due to licensing. That in itself is frustrating, but there isn’t really anything I could do about that”*

*“...in the company it is understood that \[code architecture\] requires time and that by just going fast all the time, sometimes you have to, because, ‘hey, market, you know, if you have to do something for your product you have to, but as long as the company knows that if you go faster than you have to pay the price and do it again. \[With good\] code architecture the level of stress level can be reduced so much. There’s nothing you can do about the importance because in the end, it’s what is going to help you so much along the way...\[it can\] reduce debugging a lot because if you can separate your logic in nice pieces, you’re not going to mix concerns. And so when something’s not right, you know exactly where to look.”*

*“I’m committing more often \[than I would if I were working alone\] following the guidelines of what the team set. Typically the way we do it is there’s the master branch and then we have our own topic branches that we develop...in order to have a successful coding review, you have* *to commit and push to your topic branch. Once the team is met with consensus, like, ‘Okay, I think we’re ready to go to the next version,’ we then would merge all of our code to the new would be master.”*

*“I’m managing all these tools, along with one of the other developers, it can get a bit frustrating. For instance, yesterday, the other developer upgraded our PHP on one of our systems and Jenkins broke. We couldn’t deploy any of our software...it took us three hours to figure out how to get our deployments working again.”*

*“...code quality, that’s something that becomes more and more important the more people working on \[a\] project. Same thing with architecture. The problem with all of those is they could be anywhere from less important, low level frustration to more important, high level frustration the more people there are in an organization...Code quality shows the respect you have for other developers, I think, because you’re not the only person who’s going to work on something. You have to make sure that you leave the code in a place that is going to make your life easier and everybody else’s.”*

*“\[Ops is\] getting the code out there and making sure it doesn’t fall down. As a front end dev, it’s mostly someone else’s problem, not because I don’t want to be involved, but I find that in a lot of places I’ve worked there’s this attitude that front end devs don’t know anything about Ops. It’s weird, because it’s like, ‘Why would you expect the Java Devs to know how their stuff is deployed, but not expect me to know how my stuff is deployed?’ Which I find frustrating...there was a bit of a lack of respect for the front end, which is one of the reasons I left.”*

*“Debugging, I don’t have a ton of tools based frustration or product based frustration with it. Mostly just reading other people’s, and I count \[me\] from six months ago as other people, their poorly commented spaghetti code.”*

### 雇佣 Web 开发者

![](https://insights.developer.mozilla.org/reports/assets/images/web-developer-needs-assessment-2019/p18_outliners.svg)

What we heard about hiring can be summarized with two additional need statements:

* Finding developers with the right skills

* Vetting the skills of potential hires

We learned during the pilot interviews that different regions of the world have different skill sets to offer. Hiring managers evaluate regional skill-sets when making decisions about where to post and advertise a job. Vetting the skills of developers, prior to offering them a job proves difficult, and if not properly vetted can lead to a poor hiring decision.

*“...we’ve hired three developers that didn’t work out...some of them... lied on the resume. They said they were good at certain aspects of technology where they weren’t. Because of that...we had different expectations of them and they weren’t very motivated to learn.”*

### 基础设施建设的不同

![](https://insights.developer.mozilla.org/reports/assets/images/web-developer-needs-assessment-2019/p18_outliners.svg)

This refers to intermittent power outages that affect business decisions, e.g., where to locate data centers. We experienced the impact of this first hand while trying to conduct the interviews. One of the participants was located in an area where they were experiencing intermittent power outages and was unable to complete the interview.

*“Early on, there was a decision not to deploy into the cloud because our parent company has his own data center, and the data center is located in \[a country where\] we have issues that sometimes the power goes out, or sometimes there is a network outage. It is a developing country \[it\] doesn’t have the same stability as you find in North America or Europe. We are looking into alternatives and whether or not we should be moving more of our services to the cloud, and how we can make things more stable.”*

### 克服沮丧

After exploring the topics that cause web developers frustration, but are also important to their work, the conversation shifted, focusing on the resources they use to overcome these frustrations. Two dominant resources help developers overcome frustrations. The first is a community of peers, typically personal acquaintances or acquaintances with few degrees of separation. The second is tapping into the resources available online.

When developers seek input from their community of peers, they usually have a sense of the skills and talents of others they are close with. They call upon people to help with a tactical problem such as troubleshooting an issue or help them with choices that will help them grow as a developer such as advice on what tools or frameworks they should invest their time to learn.

*“I think the best way that you can learn how to do anything in this space seems to be to have a group of people who automatically or implicitly or without much effort on your part keep you aware of news that you would otherwise not see about the state of things.”*

*“In the case of Ops, my friend is good at it. He just does it for me... that’s literally how I solved by DevOps problems. I just tell him, ‘Hey, this is my problem, can you help?’...he just tells you what to do next. And that’s very useful.”*

*“There are local developer communities. So it’s very easy...\[the\] people are really helpful. I just say, ‘Okay, I’ve done this, and what should I do next? What would you advise I do?’”*

*“...we have a few people who know \[security\] or have trained in sales and security, and we continuously go back to them...they’re just friends.”*

When developers tap into online resources, they are using the usual suspects (listed in alphabetical order): freeCodeCamp, GitHub,

Google, MDN, Reddit, Stack Overflow, W3Schools, and YouTube. Part of what makes these resources so valuable in troubleshooting and overcoming frustrations is that they provide developers access to a community beyond that they have cultivated in their networks. This broader community has very likely experienced a similar situation and can help resolve the issue, whether that is shared through forums or videos. These sites also offer official documentation, which is a key resource in troubleshooting.

*“The web is just an incredible resource because it’s almost always the case that somebody has the same question you have...”*

*“The primary point of contact \[ for troubleshooting\] is, how do I form a Google search to get to the information?”*

*“\[To overcome frustrations with something I don’t know\] I will just Google and find information or YouTube. \[Some common sites that I find to be helpful\] are Stack Overflow, and of course, Mozilla, W3Schools...\[the sites are\] easy to access, easy to find information on what I need, well organized, visually attractive, and easy to understand.”*

*“Documentation is \[the central thing for helping me overcome frustration\] partly because...you think you knew something but then after reading up on said feature or said documentation, it’s like, ‘Ah, I should be implementing it this way,’ rather than a learned know-how, so to speak.”*

### 需求是有情景的

When it comes to web development, developers experience myriad frustrations, which can represent opportunities for browser vendors to address that frustration and thereby fulfilling a need.

While this report focuses on the top ten needs of web developers, there’s more nuance to the frustrations than a top ten list can convey because needs are not static. At any given time, a web developer may be in a situation that affects what they find frustrating, why it’s frustrating, and how it causes frustration. Four main situations emerged from the pilot interviews.

* Being a part of the broad web development community.

* Working on a project for oneself without external stakeholders.

* Working on a project with requirements.

* Adapting to work cohesively within an organization or as part of a team.

Let’s consider some examples. First, we know one of the top 10 needs was, “Keeping up with a large number of new and existing tools or frameworks.” Why and how this is frustrating is experienced differently in different situations.

**Working on a project for oneself without external stakeholders.**

*“When I write code for myself I’m often doing something that’s simple so I don’t need frameworks, but more than that, I like to understand how stuff actually works and frameworks hide the implementation details.”*

**Adapting to work cohesively within an organization or as part of a team.**

*“When I go to work, we use Angular and it’s fine. If I was working somewhere else that used a different framework, I would have to adapt and learn that new framework. It’s a byproduct of what management*

*or senior developers dictate. I work with developers that are not willing to make a change or try different frameworks. Their preference is to stick with something that’s tested or something that’s already been approved by legal. For instance, the team talked about using jQuery to build a web app. We could do that, but for efficiencies sake Angular or React would be better. Legal got involved and wouldn’t let us use React due to concerns about licensing. We stuck with jQuery.”*

**Being a part of the broad web development community:**

*“I have a community of web developers. We all have different perspectives about what’s popular at the moment, what’s worth learning or not. One friend encouraged me not to learn Node JS because he felt it was too specific. But, I’ve also read many times that it’s useful and a good thing to learn. Angular is another example of something that I didn’t even know existed six months ago and I’m already getting competing opinions about whether it’s worth the time to learn.”*

The type of project a developer works on can create or eliminate frustrations because of the project’s requirements.

*“Our software only uses anonymized data that we received from a third party, so \[privacy\] is not very frustrating for us. \[We\] don’t actually have any identifying data.”*

*“I’m happy if my stuff runs well in Chrome. I’m not...trying to target old versions of Internet Explorer or something like that. So I don’t really care \[that much about browser compatibility\]. But it is important, and I would expect it to be important to somebody who hired me to build something.”*

*“I haven’t produced real marketable stuff \[where I\] had to worry about \[accessibility\]...I do a lot of this stuff for my own amusement. I’m playing with it so it just hasn’t been an issue for me. I recognize it’s import**ant, but I haven’t had just haven’t had to deal with it.”*

*“Well, I think of available tools that you could I’m thinking of like dev ops, which I don’t really need. So I don’t know if that really applies to me there. Because I’m not doing anything complex enough to require, like any deployment, to, you know, more than one place or any real integration, outside resources. So I think I’m going to leave that alone.”*

*“I’m basically trying to run a web server host some HTML, JavaScript, CSS, and deliver this to my clients. So just keeping a single web server up and running. It’s easier than having a complex framework of micro- services powering my application.”*

### 更广的看待

### 外在

The evolution of the web has led to the state of affairs where developers can pay for services, such as hosting, which reduces the need to own and maintain all of the infrastructure that was previously required to put something online. However, each piece you don’t own creates a dependency on someone or something external to your work. Dependencies present risks, and developers have to decide whether the tradeoff is worth it or not. While the upside is that making things for the web is much faster and easier, there’s a fear that their work might become obsolete should something happen to those who they are externally dependent on.

*“...owning the entire spectrum is excessive, it’s just ensuring that those trade-offs are either things that you \[can\] control the copy of that you’re using, or that you’re paying for service that you can take your money elsewhere.”*

*“Unless you are starting with HTML, CSS, JavaScript and writing your own Ajax requests, using the breadth of the browser object model, XML HTTP request API to shoot code back and forth...you’re always giving up some control over your code...In terms of importing code dependencies, that’s the cost of doing business. It just makes writing human usable applications so much faster. But the act of hosting is following that same path...the system of hosting is also being abstracted away to third parties. There are horror stories every week of somebody whose business was just stuck...years of work \[gone\] because they had built everything into Google Cloud Platform and one of the developers that they had hired on to make some tweaks to their business application was using a blacklisted Gmail account. And because of that, the app certifications were all revoked....that’s a huge externality, you have to think about...We’re hosted on Heroku, we have stuff on AWS if by some chance X service
provider disappeared, would your company also disappear? Like, if Amazon just poof was taken away by aliens tomorrow, our company would not exist...we have backups, we could spin up something else but there would be a week to two-week-long period* *where we would just be building everything back up for availability.”*

*“...my brother \[a developer\] feels he is at the whim of the creators of browsers...the concern is at some point, something that his work relies on will be obsolete by a decision that Google makes...or a decision that Microsoft makes...it’s a little scary that things advance quickly...the thing that concerns me about changes \[is that\] updates would have to be made on account of third parties, such as the creators of the browsers... you don’t have as much control over, for example, like the version of a compiler that you use, which is static...I’m referring to the obsolescence of technologies that people at one point relied on heavily...it’s hard to predict which existing technology...will end up being the one in which a flaw is uncovered and a great deal of work left to be done to move to something else.”*

### 浏览器的重生

Developers have noticed that browsers are getting better, with Internet Explorer (IE) as the exception. Developers realize this wasn’t just a kind move on the part of browser vendors to make developers’ lives easier; they understand browsers have grown in monetary importance for their creators.

*“\[Browsers have gotten better\] because the industry started to care... ten years ago...the market wasn’t as competitive, the browsers were not actually...trying to do a good job in implementing things apart from Firefox...”*

*“\[Browsers had\] been left as a second or third class citizen for ages. Now...Google is pushing on it because they live on ads so they need the browser to do whatever. Microsoft went back and started doing their own browser and it was actually good, but probably took them too much time to get up to speed and now they have to change because Edge was not as good as it should have been. Mozilla, well, Firefox since they changed to Quantum it’s... it was not getting much love before...even Apple now is doing good things on the web, even if they’re doing it at their own pace with their own reasons, but that’s Apple you cannot expect too much...”*

Better browsers is a good thing, but the consolidation of browsers concerns to some. The first concern is about a lack of competition between browser vendors leading to a lack of technological advancements. Consolidation also has implications for compatibility, which manifests in different ways.

One view is that, as each browser vendor tries to outshine the other, those advances will create differences that may result in less compatibility. However, it’s for the sake of advancements, so it’s something developers with this view can live with.

On the flip side, some developers see competition creating more compatible browsers because each will be trying to match at least what the other can do. But, as competition decreases, so might compatibility. Microsoft’s decision to adopt Chromium is perceived as reducing competition, leaving Chromium with a larger market share. There is a fear that it will become harder for other browser vendors to compete with Chromium. The browsers with less market share may not invest as much in making their browser better, leading to it becoming outdated and causing compatibility issues.

*“Browser compatibility...might lose importance because browsers are getting so much better...the further we go the less time I have to think about it because I know that everybody’s competing..now that Microsoft decided to stop developing their engine I’m worried that Chromium is going to get too much market share and that is not going to help with browser compatibility.”*

*“I think \[people moving to Chromium is\] a good thing as a designer... but as someone interested in the further development of technology, it’s not the best thing because considering everyone will start using Chromium, there won’t be a competition left. If there is no competition, the pace of development...decreases...there should always be some competition. I think Microsoft declared that they’re shifting to Chromium as well, so if they do that competition will decrease, it will be hard for Mozilla to sustain with their engine. It’s a good thing in terms of users or developers, but in terms of technological development of that particular set of a browser or how a browser evolves, it’s something bad.”*

*“...I would love to see Mozilla and Chrome competing with each other to improve the web, I see that the two are basically trying to improve the standard, I like it very much that there is no fixed standard anymore.”*

### 明白原理

Web developers understand the Web, and the surrounding ecosystem is continually changing. With that comes pros and cons. Considering, in most cases, it is their livelihood; there is a strong desire to maintain some semblance of control and understanding of their work. One way developers do this is to invest time in understanding how things work — beyond the abstractions that modern conveniences such as frameworks present. Understanding the basics boosts developers’ confidence that they can handle something when issues arise.

*“I think \[ frameworks\] are not that important because the fundamentals about how things work are more important than the specific frameworks, \[but\] for the web in general, and other developers...they allow so many more things to be done for the web.”*

*“A basic knowledge of programming is really important because  
you will use basics even \[as a\] senior...it’s really easy to make a basic mistake...it takes a lot of time to build the logic of basic programming knowledge.”*

*“If I am writing code for myself, I generally don’t use frameworks. I just go hardcore...\[so\] I know how it works, and then when I go and use it in a framework I get what the framework is doing. Whereas I think a lot of people coming in to front end, they learn the framework and they don’t know the JavaScript that’s going on underneath, which probably gets you by 80% of the time but then when something scary happens, it’s like, ‘Why did that happen? This is magic.’ I did the same where I jumped into Angular and I’m like, ‘No, this is way too much magic. I need to know what’s actually going on.’*

*“...in terms of obscuring what’s actually happening...frequently, you don’t need to know it’s enough to say, ‘Oh, in React land I’m passing this state property as a prop down to this child component,’ and that’s good enough, but what’s actually happening underneath the hood...* *when it is time to do that digging, it can be really unclear, messy if you spent all your time just living in frameworks land...”*

*“If I learn something like basic JavaScript, then I think I can switch to different frameworks.”*

### 经验丰富的开发者认识到改进

Much of this report’s focus is on the needs of developers and what causes frustrations. These frustrations are representative across many years of experience from a beginner (less than a year) to seasoned (ten or more years). Developers who fall into, or near, the seasoned camp recognize that things on the Web are better, compared to when they first started. Improvements run the gamut from tooling, deployment, debugging, layout, privacy, ES6, etc.

*“I think we have really great tools now to do web development compared to many years ago. The tools now, I mean, they can always be better, but it seems like we have really good tools \[they\] weren’t so common 8-10 years ago.”*

*“Testing is hugely important for making sure that things work as expected. There’s a bunch of really great tools available to help with that now, which I find super helpful...It used to be super frustrating, but the tools are getting better and better.”*

*“Deployment is really important, obviously, because you need to be able to put your app out there but it has become so much easier as well. Now we have services like Heroku where in just two clicks, you can deploy your app, like if it was magic. I remember in my first year we have our deploy and build scripts, they were written in Bash...”*

*“The new Grid and Flexbox \[are\] so good. And Firefox in particular, has really amazing support for being able to debug those layouts and see how they work...the grid Inspector, it’s so good, so helpful because you can actually see what’s going on. It’s like, ‘This is where the grid is, this is where the gaps are, this is why that grid is over there.’ They’ve got the Flexbox inspector as well. It’s like, ‘Why are my things all over on the left? Oh, because this is what’s being set, this space is empty gap, or this space is actually an element that turns out to be way bigger than I thought it was.’ Getting people at work to move to that way of doing things instead of floats left, it’s been fun.”*

*“When functions first came out, they were impossible to debug in the dev tools because, I don’t know what was going on it was just really hard. Whereas now the debugging tools have gotten way better and it’s way easier to do that kind of thing. As JavaScript got more asynchronous debugging, got a lot harder. And now it’s getting easier again, so that’s been great...those tools that are in the dev tools have been amazing to help with debugging.”*

*“I think there are great tools for debugging...I use the debugger in Chrome, mostly for JavaScript. For server side development I use the Ruby debugger. I also use logs. And just in general, the web console in Chrome as well, and the Network tab. All the developer tools they help with their debugging a lot.”*

*“I think layout has become much less of a pain point. Layout has been more difficult in the past, designing all these huge tables to have to achieve a certain layout...I think performance has improved dramatically, I think the tools have improved dramatically, too. I think the pace of change is also higher than ever before, I think debugging has been harder in the past. I think all these tools have improved tremendously.”*

*“Firefox or Safari implemented a really good Do Not Track engine. Safari doesn’t let me know exactly which MacBook you are using, it’s just going to look like a generic one. They do have special ways of changing the tracking cookie so it’s not going to always be the same, and that’s something that they just improved. And now Safari and Firefox are using the restrict mode, so if the user wants you can prevent people from tracking what you do. I think we’re going in a better place in terms of privacy, I’m just optimistic about it.”*

*“I used to be more frustrated and stressed out about frameworks because there are so many and they change so much, but I’m not* *frustrated anymore about that. Since JavaScript ES6 everything has become standard and I feel like using vanilla JavaScript is so much nicer than before. And I don’t think using a specific framework, knowing a specific framework is so key \[as\] it was in the past.”*

Keep in mind that while there are recognition and appreciation for how things have gotten better over time, it does not mean things are perfect. Some improvements are what lead to the current environment where developers are facing trade-offs when deciding how much to divest their control into external, third party products and services. That and the pace of change can be overwhelming.

### Web 的缺失

The same group of seasoned developers had thoughts on what is currently missing from the web. These are similar things to what was captured in survey findings and are included here to provide verbatims with more context. In addition to what’s missing, this group had thoughts on opportunities for improvement.

Web components and privacy could be better executed.

*“Web components have a great opportunity, but they wasted so much time with things that...in terms of the choices that were made, didn’t pay off like HTML imports. They we’re not the best way to approach it because all of the things that they didn’t allow in terms of good optimization.”*

*“I think \[how to overcome privacy frustrations\] is the $1 million question, right? Because I don’t think there is this something where there is no good solution currently to it...”*

Access to hardware is something that the web is missing, as well as push notifications and serverless communication.

*“Hardware access...more device API’s would be helpful. And I think, of course, also push notifications are a very important aspect. So if these two would work more reliably, or let’s say would be better supported, I think I would be very helpful”*

*“This is a very personal opinion from a computer science guy...a more event-based browser to browser model, like in the web RTC environment. If I could place anything on the list, I would say, browser to browser communication, serverless communication applications. This is something I would like to see in the future so that basically you don’t need a web server, just bring two people together like web RTC.”*

### Web 的未来

Not only do these seasoned developers recognize areas of the Web that have improved, could still use improvement or are missing entirely, they also had some thoughts to share about the future of the Web.

When it comes to the future of the web, these seasoned developers are excited for:

* WebAssembly

* Progressive Web Apps

* WebAuthn

* Speech to Text

*“WebAssembly is going to change the web. This guy is an insane level of importance. It’s going to change the web from being a mostly consumption light editing environment to a fully-featured editing environment. It provides an increase in speed that is unheard of for the web.”*

*“I think if you allow web applications to be more like native apps, then you can basically replace many of these native apps with web pages, which gives them a simple deployment model and development model for web developers.”*

*“ I just saw, now, they finally decided on the spec of WebAuthn. So once browsers \[are\] actually going to implement it is going to be much easier and safer for users to authenticate...that’s probably me hoping for a better future.”*

*“I would like to see more is text to speech and speech to text...I think this is a very important topic for the future of the web...I’m not sure if, in a few years, we will still use graphical user interfaces to interact... And I think that web applications should also be able to run headless, without having or without being forced to have a user interface, graphical user interface as their main interface towards the user. I think speech is something that should get more attenti*on...”

Though there are things to look forward to, there is a concern, and it’s not clear how widely this concern is shared. The concern is that the next generation of web developers might not see the importance of learning the fundamentals of computer science as it’s so easy to just run with examples.

*“My hardest \[job as a teacher\], what I’m trying to do...is to convince \[my students\] not to go to W3schools.com and just do an example-driven web development. My students typically think they can Google every solution, while I try to explain to them that they should first use their brain before they do something. I think they would tell me that the web is some copy and paste place and they would throw all these computer science rules overboard and just try to copy from existing projects.”*

## 结论

感谢所有组织以及完成调查的 28474 人，以及完成了部分调查的受访者们，帮助我们一起构成了开发人员需求评估的第一版，而且，尤其感谢的是十四次访谈预演的受访者，没有他们的共同参与，调查就不可能进行下去～

这项研究为参与者提供了一个机会来影响 Mozilla、Google、Microsoft、Samsung 和 W3C 等组织考虑功能开发和标准的优先程度。

开发人员需求评估的第一版以有价值的信息作为结尾，让组织可以使用这些有价值的信息为在 Web 上工作的开发人员和设计人员创造更好的体验。由于这是首次进行研究，因此该发现对工作背后的组织来说是全新的。我们仍在评估如何最好地利用结果来影响功能开发和标准。我们真的非常高兴分享组织为改善开发人员和设计师在网络上工作的经验而采取的初步行动。

**Google**

*“The Google web platform team is now using Developer Satisfaction (DSAT) as one of our top-level success metrics. We are excited to be using the MDN DNA as one of the main sources of data to help us to understand and prioritize the key areas of developer frustration.”*

**- Rick Byers, Director of Engineering for Blink, Web Platform Team**

*“Google has been working with other Chromium contributors, such as Intel, to bring access to hardware capabilities to the web, from cameras and sensors to gamepad, USB and Bluetooth APIs. We believe that any task users want to accomplish with their devices should be possible with the web, so are continuing to work on web standards to* *expose additional sensors, Serial, HID, NFC, and more.”*

**- Joshua Bell, Technical Lead/Manager, Web Platform Team**

**W3C**

*“Early reports from the survey provided valuable input to several standardization and pre-standardization discussions at W3C’s big annual meeting (TPAC). We anticipate the published report will continue to support standards progress.”*

**- Wendy Seltzer, Strategy Lead**

**Mozilla**

*“In the Firefox team we are always listening to our community’s needs in order to make product decisions. The comprehensive overview of the developer community’s needs provided by the MDN DNA report is therefore absolutely essential to us and we are already incorporating its findings into our plans.”*

**- Panagiotis Astithas, Sr. Engineering Manager, Firefox Developer Experience**

除了个人组织的行为以及互操作性是 Web 开发人员的主要痛点，主要的浏览器供应商正在合作开发跨浏览器测试套件，例如 Web 平台测试和 Test262。从事网络平台测试的小组已将2020年作为优先事项，以识别和修复最重要的测试失败并提高测试套件的质量。

## 调查和整理方法

考虑到预演的访谈给我们了一个由表及里的视角，构造我们的第一代的 DNA 调查报告，我们想提供一个关于我们如何在各个方面进行访谈的方法的文章。

**预演访谈**

为了确保受访者的是广泛的，项目相关者创建了筛选标准，帮助我们将不同的观点按照来自的国家或是性别等各种标准分离。我们在 MDN 官网上选好窜了这次调查，并且有选择地在完整作答的回答中进行了一次预演，确保我们达到了筛选标准。

那些达到标准的受访者都被我们邀请参加了我们平均一个小时长的远程采访。叙事的方法被我们采用，让人们以故事的形式，讲述他们感官中的开发世界。叙事的分析也让我们参与者更好地解释意义和真相 —— 更好地从他们的角度解释。

一个有导向性但又是开放的讨论也被采用，鼓励我们的受访者们以保持舒适且以一种聊天的氛围，贯穿整个调查的过程。语言、语调以及主题是完全由参与者决定的，也用于解释它们的陈述、动作。

为了更精准地认知受访者对于 Web 开发和设计的一个主题的感受，我们提供了一个 X - Y 轴坐标系，X 坐标轴表示受访者认为的重要性，而 Y 轴代表他们对他们所感兴趣的主题的沮丧感。

受访者们同样被我们给予一套卡片，每张卡片分别对应 Web 开发或设计的一个部分。我们让他们按照他们自己的想法，将卡片放置在坐标系中。这些部分是在调查之初就定下来的：

* Accessibility 无障碍化
* Authentication on Mobile 移动端验证
* Browser Compatibility 浏览器兼容
* Debugging 调试
* Deployment 部署
* Frameworks 框架
* Layout 布局
* Localization 本地化
* Mobile Payments 移动端支付
* Ops 运维
* Pace of change 变化的速度
* Performance 性能
* Privacy 隐私
* Security 安全
* Testing 测试
* Tools 工具
* Trends 趋势

研究人员观察受访者把卡片放在坐标系中，询问了他们把卡片放在特定的位置的原因以及卡片之间的关系。他们研究了对话语境中的语言线索，引导讨论指向受访者认为特别相关、有意义或难忘的经历。

如果受访者不明白一张卡片的意思，他们会被询问他们对于这张卡片所代表内容的理解。如果没能有具体的描述，他们会被要求把卡片移除坐标系中。在活动结束时，受访者可以创建代表所提供列表中没有的部分的卡片。指示它们以与预先提供的部分相同的方式将新定义的部分放置在网格上。

如果受访者允许，我们的采访都被录制，并拍摄了每一个创建的工件。

**分析**

在访谈之后，Pinpoint 开始了他们的分析 —— 从对转录的访谈进行详细的编码开始。他们会通读每一份采访记录来回顾叙述 —— 参与者选择谈论什么？有趣的是什么？他们是如何构造事物的？他们的语言有什么独特之处？他们希望别人怎么看待他们？

在编码数据过后，Pinpoint 开始由信息筛选转变为创建一个叙述，突出证据（他们从访谈中看到和听到的），确定见解（证据意味着什么），因为这有助于挖掘关键主题（证据为什么重要）。

**调查的创建**

对试点访谈结果的初步分析告知了调查的问题，最重要的是需求列表。最初的需求列表包括了 18 个类别中的 59 种需求陈述。这份列表最后被缩减为调查中测试的 28 种需求。MDN 产品咨询委员会（PAB）员以及 PAB 组织内的其他员工一起参与了权衡减少需求列表的过程。一个更短的需求列表可是很重要的，不然完成调查的时间会太长而且参与调查的受访者也会变少。

当一份调查草案准备好了，我们将通过用户测试和从 MDN 招募的受访者的个人访谈开始调查问卷的试点。这些试点工作是一个从我们的目标受众的角度收集早期反馈的机会，以帮助确保问题按照我们的意图得到解释。

调查问题定稿后，我们将问卷从英语本地化为其他八种语言，分别是：

* Arabic 阿拉伯语
* Chinese (simplified) 简体中文
* French 法语
* Japanese 日语
* Korean 韩语
* Portuguese (Brazil) 巴西式葡萄牙语
* Russian 俄语
* Spanish 西班牙语

调查问卷在 2019 的七月中开启，在 2019 的八月关闭。
